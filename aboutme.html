                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology began at a young age when I first discovered the power of programming. 
                    What started as curiosity quickly evolved into a deep fascination with how computers can solve complex 
                    real-world problems. This journey led me to pursue Computer Science, where I found my calling at the 
                    intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the <strong>University at Albany</strong>, 
                    where I'm diving deep into advanced topics like neural networks, cryptography, and distributed systems. 
                    My academic research focuses on developing AI-driven security solutions that can detect and prevent 
                    cyber threats in real-time.
