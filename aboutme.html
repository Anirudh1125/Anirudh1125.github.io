                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology began at a young age when I first discovered the power of programming. 
                    What started as curiosity quickly evolved into a deep fascination with how computers can solve complex 
                    real-world problems. This journey led me to pursue Computer Science, where I found my calling at the 
                    intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the <strong>University at Albany</strong>, 
                    where I'm diving deep into advanced topics like neural networks, cryptography, and distributed systems. 
                    My academic research focuses on developing AI-driven security solutions that can detect and prevent 
                    cyber threats in real-time.

                    <p>
                       I served as the Public Relations Lead for our college fest VIBHA, which saw a crowd of over 5,000 attendees. 
                       I took charge of inviting the band and DJ and coordinating celebrity invitations, 
                       ensuring smooth communication and event execution. As one of the main leads of the fest, I contributed to building 
                       partnerships, managing guest relations, and making the event a grand success.

                        As a passionate sportsperson, I had the privilege of leading Team VBIT as the Basketball Captain, guiding 
                        the team to win gold and bronze medals at the state level. Beyond basketball, I also represented Andhra Pradesh 
                        and Telangana at the national level in volleyball, earning a silver medal. These experiences strengthened my leadership,
                         teamwork, and competitive spirit across multiple sports disciplines.

                       student organizations. I was responsible for managing event logistics, coordinating with donors and medical teams, and ensuring 
                       the smooth execution of the camp. This experience strengthened my organizational, communication, and teamwork skills while 
                       contributing to a meaningful social cause.
